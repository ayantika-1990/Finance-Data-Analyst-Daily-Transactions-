# Finance-Data-Analyst-Daily-Transactions-
Analyzed daily financial transactions to uncover spending patterns, detect anomalies, and generate actionable insights using Python and data visualization tools.    

This project focuses on analyzing daily financial transactions to uncover meaningful insights into personal or business spending behavior. The analysis was done using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, covering key steps such as:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Date-wise and category-wise spending trend analysis

Identification of high-value transactions and anomalies

Visualizations to highlight spending patterns and volume

The goal is to demonstrate practical data analysis skills by converting raw transaction data into actionable insights using pandas, NumPy, and visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
